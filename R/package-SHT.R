#' Statistical Hypothesis Testing Toolbox
#' 
#' Testing statistical hypotheses is one of the most significant inference problems in statistics. 
#' As time goes by, the community has witnessed surge of unorthodox settings such as high-dimensionality 
#' as well as atypical problems galore. We, though not complete nor ambitious, try to gather up 
#' some of frequently appearing tests as many as possible. Entire list of available tests 
#' can be seen at README file.
